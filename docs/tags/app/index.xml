      <description>Ever wondered &amp;ldquo;What is the shortest sentence in english that uses all the letters of the alphabet&amp;rdquo;? Perhaps.&#xA;Did you know that &amp;ldquo;A Quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog &amp;rdquo;, although often cited, is not the shortest ?&#xA;Could you train an AI to find a shorter sentence?

Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s a slow laptop, and you need to justify buying a new one. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s rationalising how much time is being wasted in a regular, pointless meeting.</description>
