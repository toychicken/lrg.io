In January 2017 I undertook a self-funded 9 month research and development proejct. Exploring future possibilities for Web-based AR and VR. I built a custom Web VR editing tool, and worked with a number of high-profile organisations to research their futures in immersive technology. I now run packaged consulting days for businesses to understand how Virtual and Augmented reality could change their industry

Work as Studio Zero includes

Blend Media
In January 2017, I started researching the feasibility of Virtual Reality on the web (WebVR) - I built a WebVR editor tool for Blend.Media, using React & Redux on the front end. The initial prototype (built in around 3 weeks) was using AWS S3 as the store, which was then handed over to Blend’s backend team, where they built a Phoenix / Firebase / S3 system to our API spec.

The front-end continued with React & Redux - using Mozilla’s Aframe.io for the VR elements (and Aframe-react). Aframe was at an early stage of development and I had to make some contributions to Aframe just to get our project working! We used Karma / Mocha for testing. In the initial stages, I managed the product delivery, then helped their product owner plan & execute a user-testing & MVP strategy.

Tesco
I was working on a number of projects, in a consultative role, and as a developer. Their prototype team had already established a pattern of working with MeteorJS, but I introduced them to using React on the front-end, as a way to help them recruit and retain new prototype staff (as Meteor was not a common skillset) - plus it fitted with the company’s overall strategy of using React across the business.

I built out the digital design platform tool, which enabled shared React components to be reused by all the different departments across Tesco, collaborating closely with stakeholders in technical and non-tech domains

RBS / Natwest
In 2015, I worked for RBS / Natwest building a new, in-branch account opening system, built using the bank’s custom component system, Zambezi, but then had to do a rebuild, using React / Redux, when the platform failed to meet some core performance requirements for the system.

We focussed very heavily on an agile TDD / BDD approach for developing the product, working closely with the product ownership team. Given the legacy of RBS (an incredibly slow-moving organisation) in the course of a year, I helped move them onto rapid (2 week) deployment cycles, and a very strong agile process. Prior to this, release cycles were in the order of 6 months.

Director of Web Technology - Nice Agency
July 2013 – February 2015
As Director of Web Technology I was responsible for building out a web team, bringing web application capabilities to complement Nice's existing mobile tech skills. I was responsible for the delivery of all the UK based web projects, as well as being involved in hands-on delivery for a number of significant projects.

In 2014, I lead the team that delivered the award-winning i100.co.uk for the Independent. An entirely new viral news property, which has exceeded all expectations at launch, and has garnered fantastic praise from across the industry. We built it entirely from scratch, with Node.js, creating a bespoke, highly-optimised CMS for viral news writers; and a responsive mobile-optimised front-end.
