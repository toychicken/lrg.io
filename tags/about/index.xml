      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to talk about myself&amp;hellip; Hmm&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was born in the south in the 70s, but formed by the north in the 80s. I got my first computer when I was 7, and loved drama, music and art at school. I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that I did&amp;hellip; okay&amp;hellip; at school, as much in spite of the education system, as because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was not an especially rebellious person, but that was partly because rebellion seemed like a rich kids game. In the late 80s I discovered the rave scene, and somehow emerged from that in the mid nineties with a degree in Fine Art, and a specialism in digital, video &amp;amp; performance art.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
