      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is scary. Even asking questions may bring down, as yet unknowable, consequences. You may well want to give up and live in a shack in the middle of nowhere. This is fine, and good luck, but it&amp;rsquo;s not where I am.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mostly for my own benefit, I need to pose some questions and answer them as rationally as I can. I need, in my own small way, to be pragmatic about the actions I can take, and my expectations of the actions of others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
