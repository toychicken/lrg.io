        <p>I have been making things with computers for about 35 years. The last 20 have almost exclusively been on the
            web, and the last 12 have been delivering web products and applications for some of the worlds biggest
            banks, retailers, airlines, newspapers, and government departments.</p>
        <p>As a developer and product manager, I have an unique ability to manage requirements, teams and stakeholders to
            deliver world-class products.</p>
        <p>In 2015 I founded Studio Zero, to deliver new digital products, and help companies large and small realise
            new business models via the web and emerging media.</p>

        <h3 id="studio-zero-ltd"><a href="#studio-zero-ltd">Studio Zero Ltd</a></h3>
        <p>Work as Studio Zero includes</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>John Lewis Ventures</strong><br/>
                    Working for one of John Lewis Ventures' earliest (and most successful) propositions - <a href="http://cookwell.recipes/LEIGHG50">Cook Well</a>. My role is to help it transform from it's early MVP state into a stable, scalable product that would work well with the parent (Waitrose) brand. It's a small cross-functional team, and I work closely with the UX team and product owner to define requirements, respond to user research. I also manage the offshore development team.</p></li>
            <li><p>In January 2017 I undertook a self-funded 9 month research and development project. Exploring future
                possibilities for Web-based AR and VR. I built a custom Web VR editing tool, and worked with a number of
                high-profile organisations to research their futures in immersive technology. </p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Blend Media</strong><br/> I built a WebVR editor tool for Blend.Media, using React & Redux on
                the front end. The initial prototype (built in around 3 weeks) was using AWS S3 as the store, which was
                then handed over to Blendâ€™s backend team, where they built a Phoenix / Firebase / S3 system to our API
                spec. </p>
                <p>The front-end continued with React & Redux - using Mozillaâ€™s Aframe.io for the VR elements (and
                    Aframe-react). Aframe was at an early stage of development and I had to make some contributions to
                    Aframe just to get our project working! We used Karma / Mocha for testing. In the initial stages, I
                    managed the product delivery, then helped their product owner plan & execute a user-testing & MVP
                    strategy. </p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Tesco</strong><br/>I was working on a number of projects, in a consultative role, and as a
                developer. Their prototype team had already established a pattern of working with MeteorJS, but I
                introduced them to using React on the front-end, as a way to help them recruit and retain new prototype
                staff (as Meteor was not a common skillset) - plus it fitted with the companyâ€™s overall strategy of
                using React across the business. </p>
                <p>I built out the digital design platform tool, which enabled shared React components to be reused by
                    all the different departments across Tesco, collaborating closely with stakeholders in technical and
                    non-tech domains</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>RBS / Natwest </strong><br/> In 2015, I worked for RBS / Natwest building a new, in-branch
                account opening system, built using the bankâ€™s custom component system, Zambezi, but then had to do a
                rebuild, using React / Redux, when the platform failed to meet some core performance requirements for
                the system. </p>
                <p>We focussed very heavily on an agile TDD / BDD approach for developing the product, working closely
                    with the product ownership team. Given the legacy of RBS (an incredibly slow-moving organisation) in
                    the course of a year, I helped move them onto rapid (2 week) deployment cycles, and a very strong
                    agile process. Prior to this, release cycles were in the order of 6 months.</p></li>

                has garnered fantastic praise from across the industry. We built it entirely from scratch, with Node.js,
                creating a bespoke, highly-optimised CMS for viral news writers; and a responsive mobile-optimised

I really appreciate you checking out my page with the dev tools. There's not much to see under the hood, unfortunately.

I'm not running any analytics, or 3rd party trackers. I'm not using a fancy library or framework to generate my CV from an API and optimise it on the fly for different devices.

I'm not A/B testing this CV to see what performs better, nor am I user a tag to track how long you're spending on different parts of the page.

I haven't created a design manual, or working process that will make generating future CVs more effective and efficient.

But, I COULD do any of these things, and I could do them for you.

You should hire me.`)
