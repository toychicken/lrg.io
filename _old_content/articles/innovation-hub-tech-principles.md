One problem for innovation labs is that of 'mixing' with corporate IT. For _very_ good reasons, most IT departments are risk-averse where it comes to security, stability and spending.

However, in the innovation lab it's a slightly different story. Security should still be paramount, but in the world of early-stage propositions, there are advantages in spending (you can do a lot with 'Free' tier software) and stability (set expectations with customers early).

The flip side to this is that we then have an expectation that the propositions will need to merge into the main business at the point their value has been proven.

With this in mind, working for a big UK retailer, I have recently come up with some "principles for guided evolution" aimed squarely at innovation hubs. The purpose is to help tech folks manage the tension between being lean and agile AND getting ready for transition back into the business.

## The laboratory

It's important that we remember what the function of most innovation hubs is. Typically, it can be summed up like this:

> "A laboratory for generating validated learning. A place to identify and develop new opportunities and capabilities for the main business."

With this in mind, our principles must balance the needs of the lab, with the needs of the business.

Ideally, the main business wants the lab to use existing contracted products. In practice, many of those services are limited to specific domains, require teams of people with specialist product skills, have inter-dependent needs and most of all, cost a _lot_ of money.

A start-up however, can achieve a lot with a free-tier Cloud server, Mailchimp and Google analytics.

So how do we reconcile the cautious parent with fast-moving child?

> 	* Good today, not perfect tomorrow
> 	* Love it or trash it
> 	* Secure from the start
> 	* Improve everything we touch
> 	* Tested is trusted
>   * Choosing a good death

Generally speaking, innovation labs should not care
