I was reminded recently of an article ([The Sudden Death of the Website](https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/the-sudden-death-of-the-website/)) that was posted in 2018, by Rob LoCascio, CEO of LivePerson, predicting that "_In 2018, we will see the first major brand shut down its website._".

LoCascio says "_only a handful of brands (think: Amazon, eBay and Netflix) have found success with e-commerce at any real scale_" - perhaps if you define 'scale' in the context of being globally known, but I can think plenty of other retailers that run pretty successful businesses by any measure.

He did make some good points about the prospects of conversational commerce (an area that Rob has good reason to consider himself expert), but criticising Google (and bizarrely, HTML) for lack of retailer differentiation is like blaming mall operators for expecting shops to have windows.

It's a routine argument that the web has to answer. Apps were going to kill the web in the late noughties. Now it's AI, voice and conversation. It won't happen, because (at least whilst the web is relatively open and frictionless) it's superpower is _discoverability_.

If you don't think discoverability is important, try finding the best camera app in the app store, or Google play. Try asking Alexa to find, and read you the contents of an obscure art history journal. Get Siri to find you a second-hand modestly-priced SUV. I'm not saying it's impossible, but I know how I'd rather do it.

Arguably, at the point at which it becomes _as easy_ to do the things Google does now for the web, via Alexa or WhatsApp, then we have to ask the same questions of them as we do Google. How do the algorithms of the gatekeepers skew what we see? But, this is not a question for the web, it's a question for the companies that create the gateways.

The web, because of it's general openness and low barriers to entry, is a fantastic platform for almost anything. It's constantly adapting too. Worried about the threat of apps, Web developers created PWAs - and now the web has apps that can do almost _anything_ a 'native' app can do. Seeing the rise of IoT, Mozilla has [announced WebThings](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/introducing-mozilla-webthings/) (arguably a bit of a misnoma, but is intended with the spirit of the web).

Of course, the web is not without it's issues. [URLs are problematic](https://noncombatant.org/2017/11/07/problems-of-urls/), browser diversity is diminishing, the undoing of net neutrality threatens the underlying fabric, and increasing centralisation of culture and resources challenges the very distributed nature of the web.

Of course, apps didn't die as the web recouped, they learned to live in concert with the web, as will voice and conversational commerce. The retailers that LoCascio cites as web successes are heavy users of non-web tech (Think how many smart-TV installations Netflix & Prime video have). In reality, they're all 'just' apps, jostling for position on the internet, it's just the web is the most mature.

So, far from being dead or dying, the web is thriving and rightly so. I don't think any big brand will intentionally be shutting their website right now, unless they want to go into hiding.
