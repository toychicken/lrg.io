## First, why?

A pre-mortem is time-travel. Time travel can be a useful device to get people to think differently about work that _should_ be done today, but feels inconvenient or unnecessary. Check out my article about the [importance of testing!](/articles/testing-times)

It's a great way to:

 * Drive out issues that have perhaps been acknowledged in isolation, but the full impact is being ignored.
 * Focus on some of the 'nice-to-haves' that might actually prove to be a key differentiator in the future.


## How do we run a pre-mortem?

In a pre-mortem the purpose is to identify unrealised threats or opportunities, then act on them. Here's how we do it.

You'll need:

* A room
* Sticky notes & pens for each participant
* A board or wall to stick them on!


### Find the cause of death
**_10 mins_ | You need two groups** _or you can alternate with the same group if it's a small team - say less than 6_

You're imagining your product at a future date. In one scenario, the product is dead, and the team is conducting a post-mortem to establish cause of death. In the other, the team is planning a press conference to celebrate a roaring success. I usually try to imagine the product in 6 months time, or you might want to choose a significant milestone date, like a month after launch.

* Group 1 (Coroners):  You'll be focusing on the negatives. Taking it in turns, write down what you think has killed your product. It can be pretty wild and imaginative - but try to stick to things that the team could have prevented.

* Group 2 (Marketing): You'll be focusing on the upside. Taking it in turns, write down ways that the product has exceeded all expectations. Focus on specifics rather than 'everyone loves us', but go ahead and be super-optimistic.

Get the stickies on the wall as you think of them, but don't talk until the time is up.

### Quick grouping exercise
**_5 mins_**

Each group should quickly review the tickets to make sure they're understood by the group, and arrange them into broad themes.

### Cross-examine

Each group should then take turns to cross-examine the other's tickets? The aim is to get a deeper understanding of the opportunity or threat. Get into the detail, and shine a light on any assumptions.

Identify up to 3 threats and opportunities.

### Take action!

Don't leave the room until you have decided on _how_ you will mitigate the threats, and take advantage of the opportunities. If they're complex, create a high-level plan to deal with them, and assign an owner to coordinate the work.
