Two important lessons I learned as a young man, temping my way through Art School and University. They are contrary, but I have found them to be helpful to consider.

* You can do a surprisingly large amount of work by hand, and learn a lot in the process.
* It can take a lot of work to automate a task, but you learn a lot in the process.

As I've spent most of my career as various kinds of software developer, I've spent a _lot_ of time automating stuff that saves people a lot of time or effort. Often spending large amounts of effort on superficially 'easy' subjects that have turned out to be (very) complex. Dates, route-planning, and even UK postcodes spring to mind. However, I've learned a lot in the process of automating work.

Conversely, and perhaps more importantly, there are things that are _actually_ easy to automate, but in doing so, you lose a lot of nuance and vital information.

I was recently working on a project, and our part-time data person was unable to keep up with the volume of feedback from our customer base. In response, they switched to running the feedback through a word-cloud generator, in an effort to pick out themes. Suddenly the weekly review meeting was much easier. There were some themes which appeared large, and they were accepted as truth. However, much of the nuance of the commentary was _missed_. In some cases the app was classifying negative AND positive comments as having the 


* Sometimes people are not as unique as they think

If I learned anything as a young man, temping my way through art school and university, it's that sometimes you can finish a task manually a lot quicker than you can automate the same job. Not only that, but there's also a good chance you'll learn a lot about your customers, your data, and your business in the process of doing it.
