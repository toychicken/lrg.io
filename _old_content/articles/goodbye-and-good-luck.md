I've been lucky enough to work for one of the most productive business innovation units I've ever seen at [John Lewis Partnership Ventures](http://www.jlpventures.co.uk/). Yet, I'm leaving. My contract has come to an end, but for the first time in many years, I'm genuinely sorry to be going.

In the space of 3 years, a team grew from nothing to around 50 people. We've launched a dozen working propositions, killed a dozen more. Scaled four of them and transitioned two back into the main business.

There have been plenty of mistakes along the way. We didn't really have sufficient business sponsorship for one promising scale-up, and it withered on the vine. We had an obscure mechanism for creating new propositions, so they either didn't happen, or felt like they came out of thin air. Team days used to feel a little like a senior management broadcast opportunity. As a team we learned and more importantly, we acted on what we learned.

However, as I leave (and yes, it's unrelated) the parent business is having a major restructure. It's tough times in retail, and they're having to be pretty ruthless about what they focus on. Our happy band is being split up, and taken back into the mothership. The hope and expectation is that the spirit of Ventures will be carried with our team members. That they'll imbue the rest of the business with a new innovative vigour. I hope that is the case. There's something unique about JLP, but the weight of the legacy business could easily crush it.

I know that wherever they end up, Ventures will have changed the way that we think and work (hopefully, mostly) for the better.

For me... it's simple. I'm on the market again, looking for an opportunity to make Ventures the second-best place I've worked.
