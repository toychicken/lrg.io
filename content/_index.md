Hey there world. It's me, Leigh

I like to start with words, because... they're really easy to put into a computer.  I'm just using a pretty standard keyboard RIGHT NOW to enter them.

It's amazing. 

Where to start... I've introduced myself, this is easily my tenth personal site, and I am not sure I've learned anything by re-doing them over and over... I suppose it's fun?
