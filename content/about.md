How to talk about myself... Hmm...

I was born in the south in the 70s, but formed by the north in the 80s. I got my first computer when I was 7, and loved drama, music and art at school. I think it's fair to say that I did... okay... at school, as much in spite of the education system, as because of it. 

I was not an especially rebellious person, but that was partly because rebellion seemed like a rich kids game. In the late 80s I discovered the rave scene, and somehow emerged from that in the mid nineties with a degree in Fine Art, and a specialism in digital, video & performance art. 

At this point, I discovered the internet, moved to London. I worked for an Architect firm, then became "New Media Studio Manager" for a millenium charity. In 1998 I met the love of my life, Dr G (who was then just Miss H).

Moved out to the arse end of nowhere in 2003, thinking it'd be like River Cottage, but it turned out to be a lot more 'League of Gentlemen'. Joined a magazine company to help them build websites, and in 2007 moved to Cambridgeshire and joined SapientNitro in London. I had many adventures with them, but that's war stories for another day.

In 2013 Baby G was born, and that rocked my world. They're the best.

Around 2017, after some dalliances with a mobile agency and doing virtual reality, I joined with another Lee, to eventually become [Doubly Good](https://doublygood.co.uk), which is about where I am now.

I still love games, music, video, art and making things when I can. I can still hold tune and a beat, which is handy for the odd Karaoke night.

Now? Well, I guess you should check out my [now page](/now).

Love

LRG
