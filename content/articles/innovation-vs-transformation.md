Many large enterprises (especially those that were born before the internet age) are struggling to reconcile social, economic and technological disruption at a pace not seen since the dawn of the industrial revolution. They see fast-moving businesses that didn't exist a few years ago dominate entire sectors before the incumbents have even realised what's happening.

In many businesses that I've worked for, 'Innovation' and 'Transformation' are whispered in the same excited breath. My experience, however, is that many business conflate the two activities in problematic ways. In an ideal world, a business will have an innovation lab _and_ a transformation unit.

What I find, is that whilst transformation units are seen as a necessary evil to be avoided if possible, businesses _love_ the idea of an 'innovation lab', because it _sounds_ cool, and might just produce the third leg to prop-up a struggling enterprise. Senior people justify the expense and risk of running such a project by citing such abstract benefits as:

* "Cutting through the bureaucracy"
* "Exploring new ways of working"
* "Creating valuable new businesses"

The intentions are honourable, but the problem is, if you have a business that needs to "cut through bureaucracy" or "explore new ways of working" an innovation lab is unlikely to help you. Alternatively - if it _does_ help, then that lab is going to be more concerned with ways of working than "creating valuable businesses".

That's not to say that there's no relationship between the innovation lab and the transformation unit. The ultimate objective is the same - help the main business survive.

However, most innovation labs will _not_ produce new unicorn businesses. Often because they're required to help transform the parent business, most will fail to produce anything at all. Although successful innovation and transformation share many requirements (strong senior stakeholder buy-in, for example), transformation is something to be done with the _whole_ business in mind. Innovation can happen at arms length, and be brought into the fold when it's successful.

To summarise. Innovation labs are successful when they're able to rapidly learn about new opportunities. Transformation is successful when the business is able to keep pace with competitors and meet evolving customer expectations.
