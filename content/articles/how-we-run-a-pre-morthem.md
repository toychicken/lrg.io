## How do we run a pre-mortem?

Essentially you're imagining yourself in the future, looking at your product or service. Time travel can be a useful device to get people to think differently about work that should be done today, but feels inconvenient or unnecessary. Check out my article about the [importance of testing!](/articles/testing-times)

In a pre-mortem the purpose is to identify unrealised threats or opportunities, then act on them. Here's how we do it.

1. _10 mins_ | You need two groups (or you can do both group actions with the same group if it's a small team - say less than 6)

	* Group 1:  You'll be focusing on the negatives. Taking it in turns, write down what you think has killed your product. It can be pretty wild and imaginative - but try to stick to things that the team could have prevented.
	* Group 2: You'll be focusing on the upside. Taking it in turns, write down ways that the product has exceeded all expectations. Focus on specifics rather than 'everyone loves us', but go ahead and be super-optimistic.

1. _10 mins_ | Pull it apart and find the themes. Cross-examine the stickies.
