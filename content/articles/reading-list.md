Partly for my own sanity, I'm keeping a list of things that I find helpful and/or interesting.

## Organisations

* [Mind the product](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/)

## Articles

* [Why aren't you talking about how much your team costs?](https://deanondelivery.com/product-owners-why-arent-you-talking-about-how-much-your-team-costs-ddfea4d44d74)
* [10x not 10%](https://www.kennorton.com/essays/10x-not-10-percent.html)

## Books

Just a note - buying from the links with a :pound: will earn me a tiny commission from the Amazon affiliate scheme or similar, and will go towards the running costs of this site.
