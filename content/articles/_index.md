# A _plethora_ of things to read

What you have here is a loose collection of my thoughts regarding product management and business transformation, technology, ethics and some maybe some thinly veiled rants about current work. Ultimately, this _is_ a personal account, so it may occasionally branch off into hitherto unexpected areas of interest.

Also, a small warning. :warning: I tend to use a lot of analogies, similies and metaphors. I'm trying to improve, and make my writing more unambiguous, so don't be afraid to tell me if I haven't made my point.

If you like what you read, please go ahead and share this stuff on your social media platform of choice. If you don't, please go ahead and put it on Twitter :smirk:.
