Today I'd like to illustrate another common state of business transformation. One that I like to call 'Never-never land'. Where your strategies may have successes but, they'll never grow up.

For many large enterprises, setting up an Innovation lab is becoming a way to deal with institutional inertia. The idea is, that if you give some of your brightest people a free rein to make transformational changes, the entire business will benefit.

In my illustration, the parent business has done many things that others fail to do. They have an active C-level stakeholder, that's committed to making the department a success. They've found department level leadership that is motivated and talented, and given them a team of people that are determined not to fall into old ways of working. They have a culture of customer-focussed research and a lean startup mentality. Finally, to cap it all, they have launched a number of successful propositions that actually _generate revenue_.

Department X have seven propositions in various stages of development. Two of which are well established, with a solid idea of  their product-market fit, and proven revenue streams. Let's call these 'A1' and 'A2'

Two more are simple 'hacks' whose value is so obvious that it's uncertain why they're not simply being done by the main business anyway. These are 'B1' and 'B2'

Another two are at a relatively early exploratory stages, but are still well within the comfort zone of the parent business. These are our 'R1' and 'R2'

Only one proposition has _anything_ that could be considered innovative _outside_ the parent business. However, it's not generating revenue and has many technical and product-market fit hurdles to overcome. I'm going to call this one 'Y1'

All of the propositions, are guilty to a greater or lesser extent of 'hacking the business'. Rather than build their own brand, they use the parent brand. Instead of owning their own marketing, they  (are forced to) go through the parent channels. With the slight exception of Y1, they are buying lots of 3rd party services, rather than do the 'hard' approach of improving the parent capabilities.

For example, A1 has recently hit a speedbump. It's 3rd party logistics supplier has

Every proposition in Dept X has to go before a board approximately every 6 months. The board's function is to decide whether or not to continue funding the proposition. The proposition has to go before the board and describe it's progress, strategy and justification (if necessary) for further funding.

There is also _another_ board that sits at the parent business, whose role is to decide whether to take
