In digital transformation, it's tempting to drive innovation by 'hacking' what the business already does - but to serve a new market, or bypass an existing process that is seen as inefficient. Whilst it might drive some small incremental gains, does it actually work?

I do a lot of work for large organisations that have some kind of 'business transformation unit'. They often have dynamic sounding names like 'Ventures', 'Digital Labs', or '[Skunkworks](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/03/06/275258/index.htm)'. They are set up to deliberately go against the grain of the main enterprise, or operate outside of normal constraints. However, the relationship between parent and errant child can be tricky.



Possible outcomes

* The bottomless hole (Everything styled to look amazing, but doesn't produce)
* The research unit (talented people that are good at talking to customers - vision not strong enough)
* The alt-marketing department (because they get used to talking a good game)
* The Peter Pan zone (where no project ever grows up)
* The Halley's comet (operating so far away from the main business, it only touches base every 76 years)

By their nature, these departments often have talented, driven people. They often produce good results in one area (if not all areas) - but unless there's a strategy

Fundamentally, business transformation can't be done by 'hacking'. New '10x' businesses can't be grown by
