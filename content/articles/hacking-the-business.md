#### There's two articles here - one about _hacking_ the business to shim the business, the other about the failure of innovation labs to generate real outcomes... which is it?

In business transformation, it's tempting to drive innovation by 'hacking' what the business already does to serve a new market, or bypass an existing process that is seen as inefficient. Whilst it might drive some small incremental gains, does it actually work?

I do a lot of work for large organisations that have some kind of Innovation lab. They often have dynamic sounding names like 'Ventures', 'Digital Labs', or '[Skunkworks](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/03/06/275258/index.htm)'. They are set up to deliberately go against the grain of the main enterprise, or operate outside of normal constraints. However, the relationship between parent and errant child can be tricky.

For my own purposes, I've identified a few of the typical ineffective states that innovation labs end up in. They're all fixable.

## The research unit

### Symptoms

One of the more common states, the 'research unit' often grows where there's talented people that have a great skill set in talking to customers, but stewards of the lab tend to find that senior stakeholders are either unable or unwilling to take the research and bring it back into the main business.

The lack of innovation can be masked by a sense of achieving valuable work - but eventually the 'do-ers' in the lab tend to drift away, finding that it's hard to turn the research into new products or services.

### Treatment

The good news is you have a foundation for creating good propositions, but some work needs to be done in the stewardship of the whole department. There are a number of treatments available. If production capability is lacking, it's recommended to introduce a small number of
* The alt-marketing department (because they get used to talking a good game, but don't build products)
* Never-never land (where no project ever grows up)
* The shim unit
* The Halley's comet (operating so far away from the main business, it only touches base every 76 years)
* The bottomless hole (Everything styled to look amazing, but doesn't produce)

By their nature, these departments often have talented, driven people. They often produce good results in one area (if not all areas) - but unless there's a strategy

Fundamentally, innovation can't be done by 'hacking'. New '10x' businesses can't be grown by hedging
