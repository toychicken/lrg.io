Quick recap: Meta is Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp and [some others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Meta_Platforms#Acquisitions) that are less relevant.

## Why should I get off Meta Messaging? 

It comes down to 2 things. One is technical, the other is societal. They're intertwined because the societal part is dependent on your feelings about the technical part and vice versa.

This is fundamental to how social media organisations work. They don't care as much about the _specifics_ of what we say to one another, but to _whom_ we say it. It's called the social graph.

When you and I have a conversation, Dear Reader, Meta learns a little bit about us. Who we talk to, when we talk, where we are and how we communicate. This is called `metadata` and oh, how we laughed when Facebook rebranded to Meta, because they literally told us what they care about.

 Armed with a little bit of metadata, there's not much that Meta can tell about us. If you assume they're not lying about the security of the message contents. Here's what an imagined message log might look like for two people exchanging messages.
 
```
user353215089723 sent message to user2938470575
user2938470575 received message from user353215089723
```

Oh, don't forget the meta data. Let's look at the first log entry.

```
user353215089723 sent message to user2938470575
	datetime:2024-11-07T11:20:01.002+000
	phone: Samsung A10, android 9.4.12, Vodafone
	connection: WiFi
		ssid: BTinternet
	location: 52.6043239,1.7322071
	message:
		status: read by recipient
		contents: [encrypted]
		attachments: 0
```

Oh, so whilst they don't know what's IN the message, they can see a lot *about* it. 

### OK, so what?

Let's imagine for a moment, that on the strength of this information, we were going to make a judgement about `user353215089723`  what might we infer from this? Let's convert this meta information to something a bit more 'real' 

* It's 7th November 2024, at 11:20am local time.
* The user is on a Vodafone-locked Samsung A10 (a 4-yr old, mid-budget phone in 2024), on an out-of-date version of Android.
* They're connected to a BTinternet Wifi (a domestic wifi service)
* They're in Great Yarmouth - a UK town that has a high amount of poverty.

I think it's fair to say, that it's widely understood that Meta sells it's data to advertisers, in order to make money. Without digging into that further, what might an agency buying advertising space from meta *infer* from the metadata provided here?

* They are at likely to be at home. This home is in Great Yarmouth.
* They have an old model Samsung phone. They're currently Vodafone users.

Not a great deal to go on, but an ad placement agency might decide to push a Vodafone / Samsung deal advert into an available Facebook slot for this user.

So, technically Meta can't show _you_ an ad, solely based on your WhatsApp data. Because if you don't use Facebook, they have nowhere to show you an ad. (Or do they?)

![](zeoob.com_ysdl7jhriy_photo.png)

This is true. This is what is important about Meta (and most big ad-revenue-driven tech corps). They don't care about you individually. They care about you as a demographic.

### About demographics

Are you a Boomer, Gen-xer, Millennial or Alpha? Did you see Mad Men? Do you remember how they would talk about target audiences? Perhaps they might say "married women" or "men over 40". They might have used phrases like "AB's" and "CDE's" to describe socio-economic groups. It was not terribly sophisticated, but it does inform how people tend to think about demographic groups. These groups might consist of millions of people, and advertisers in the past would use _mass_-media to target them. 

Nowadays however, you are not a faceless person in a target group of millions. You are a person in a very, very specific group. In fact, Meta might not care about you at all (especially if they can't show you an ad) but you can improve their knowledge of the groups you're in.

From our message above, Meta knows a little about you. However, don't forget that Meta also knows all the things you put into the app. Perhaps a photo, some kind of status update - but most useful is _your contacts_.

Let's go back to our exchange from earlier, and add some contact context.
### Adding context

Our sample message was _from_ `user353215089723`, to `user2938470575` but let's call them by their proper name, as stored in your contacts: `Solicitor, Arnold & Arnold associates, +447890123456` - This changes the value to an ad-space buyer. Now you're someone that has legal needs,  or perhaps is buying / selling a house.

Maybe `user2938470575` is simply saved as `Mum` we now know you have a Mum that you speak to. As 'Mum' has you saved in _her_ WhatsApp contacts as `Julia`, now Meta knows your name, fi it didn't already. Based on relationship and gendered naming conventions, we can assume both are women.

OK - again - so what? Meta can't show you an ad, unless you use Facebook or Instagram, right? Right.

**It's not about you**

It's about your social graph. Who you know, and who knows you. The more they know about you, the more they know about _everyone_ you are connected to.

So far, we've only looked at the assumptions made by an ad-buyer, based on the meta information contained in a single text message on WhatsApp. In the days before social media, an ad-buyer might have purchased a billboard space in Great Yarmouth offering the latest budget Samsung / Vodafone deals. There's lots of CDE people in Great Yarmouth, so it'd have been worth the bet.

Now however, Meta knows a very large amount about a very large number of people. I think it must be almost impossible[^tinfoil_hat] to be a person that does not have a single contact that doesn't have a Facebook or Instagram account.

This changes the concept of demographics entirely. Even without looking at behaviour patterns  or sophisticated 'likelihood to buy' algorithms, Meta can put people into incredibly niche demographic groupings. Let's assume that `Julia` does not use Facebook, but has a great number of contacts in their WhatsApp that do. Every time Julia sends a message, she is adding to the information about that part of the social graph. If we can infer gender, location, relationships, socio-economic status, known brands, etc etc from one single message, imagine how specific we can make a group based on trillions of related messages, facebook posts, likes, re-posts etc etc etc. (And this is before we talk about data-sharing agreements with other big tech orgs).

So, when Meta says they don't sell your information, they are technically telling the truth. What they do is sell data _about_ you in a sophisticated demographic grouping that might only contain you. So, when `Mum` next opens Facebook, she may well see a "Why not give your loved ones an upgrade to the Samsung A15 this Christmas? Love Vodafone. x (nearest store, High Street, Great Yarmouth)". In fact, they *could* even say "Why not buy Julia..." but they probably won't because it'd seem too creepy.

## If you're happy, I'm happy

Just to recap. Let's be clear about what Meta has built. 

> A giant data gathering system that makes assumptions about the values,  physical state, location, financial condition, habits, hobbies, education, employment and much more, about almost everyone that has a smartphone, or is in regular contact with someone that does.
> 
> Technically it does not target individuals but people that match given sets of target conditions. 
> 
> It makes money around the world by promoting paid-for targeted content and encouraging people to engage with this paid-for content. It is run from the USA, and is publicly owned, although the majority of shares are owned by private investors.

As a message promoter, Meta can sell you a bunch of options to show content to:

* People in a given country that love dancing!
* High-school students that recently clicked links for abortion service providers.
* Followers of this celebrity!
* People that have liked this post about illegal immigrants.

So far, you might be forgiven for thinking 'promoted content' was adverts. It certainly _includes_
obvious adverts, but it also includes stuff that looks a lot more like 'regular' posts. Why is this  important?

### Who promotes content?

Ever joined a group on Facebook? A funny meme account, or local support / gossip group? A charity that organises drop-in sessions for drug addicts? If you're in that group, you can see an awful lot who every member is, and get their data. (Same with groups on other Meta channels). 

Joining a group is something that's frequently promoted. So, I join a group called followers of "John Doe" - an outrageous standup comic that I like.

Now, John Doe says something that upsets an ultra-conservative religious organisation, that decide they want to harass (or worse) John Doe's fans. It's _trivial_ to get details of the members of that group. 

Apply this same level of ease of getting information about anyone on Facebook to any group that you might have beef with, whether it's a local busybody that doesn't like your opinions on a building project, or a government that doesn't like your views at all.

Any person or organisation that seeks to control, suppress or otherwise antagonise others would simply need to promote a group that would make them a well-known target.

In fact, it doesn't even need to be a group. It could simply be a promoted post. Everyone that likes, comments or makes an explicit interaction with that post is now known to the promoter.
## Footnotes

[^tinfoil_hat]: You would have to be the kind of person that was both cautious and diligent about *not* storing phone numbers in your phone's contacts app.
