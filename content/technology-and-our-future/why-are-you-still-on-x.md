Now that Elon Musk has made his allegiances and motivations pretty clear, I have to ask a question. Why are you still on X?

I get it. You're a big organisation and in some ways, in spite of that size, you're vulnerable if you lose your audience. But, I have to ask again. Why are you still on X?

I do understand you have an audience there, people that interact with your posts, and Elon tells you that you're an important voice. Perhaps you're a verified user. But, I do wonder. Why you are still on X?

Maybe you feel that X drives people to your organisation's website, and possibly even to becoming customers. But I have to ask, why are you still on X?

Perhaps the people that are on X, and that own it, are aligned to your organisation's values. If that's the case. So be it. But if not, then I say again. Why, oh why, are you still on X?

Did you forget how fascism starts, or how it gains and holds power? How it turns that power against anyone who doesn't agree or comply? Perhaps you forgot how this power is enabled by propaganda and disinformation? Maybe you forgot to do something instead of nothing, to stay silent instead of speaking up, to stick to your position instead of moving on. 

That's okay, I understand. It's not easy. But I do have a question for you. Given the alternatives, why are you still on X?
