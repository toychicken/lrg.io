This is scary. Even asking questions may bring down, as yet unknowable, consequences. You may well want to give up and live in a shack in the middle of nowhere. This is fine, and good luck, but it's not where I am.

Mostly for my own benefit, I need to pose some questions and answer them as rationally as I can. I need, in my own small way, to be pragmatic about the actions I can take, and my expectations of the actions of others.
