This showed up in my feed today, and I just felt like I needed to talk about it.

![Tweet from Marc Andreessen: "A world in which human wages crash from AI - logically, necessarily -- is a world in which productivity growth goes through the roof, and prices for goods and services crash to near zero. Consumer cornucopia. Everything you need and want for pennies."](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250127101958.png)
Just for your own sanity what you do do not log into Marc Andreessen Twitter account and look at it because it's absolutely stark raving bonkers there is so much cognitive dissonance in there. It should be locked in the anechoic chamber so that it sounds never escape.

 let's be clear about this crashes are never good. When was the last time you had a car crash and thought great this will really enable something good to happen in my life? When was the last time there was a financial crash and everybody said that's fantastic now there's all this opportunity lying around that we can just take?

The problem is people like this are living in a never never world where on one hand they still assume that pricing is set relative to the cost of production and on the other when you remove human wages will all be able to afford to buy really cheap things. It doesn't matter how cheap something is if you have nothing you will not be able to afford it.



Oh God. I can't even continue to write this. My mind is simply overwhelmed now by the volume of fascism in the United States. I have to focus closer to home.
