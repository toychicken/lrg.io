Another clock experiment, this time a direct successor to my original Hexclock from 10+ years ago. I wanted to update it a little, to use multiple gradients and improve the way that they were calculated. As with the [TV ident clock](tv-ident-clock-01) I'm not using any libraries, frameworks or stuff like that, with the aim of keeping my JS & CSS up to date.
