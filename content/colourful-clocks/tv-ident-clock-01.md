This is the first of my re-visits of a project I did a while ago, the 'Hex clock' (which was itself a CSS copy of a thing called the colourclock, which I  think is now defunct)

This is inspired by those clocks that used to run before educational programming on BBC2 in the 70s and 80s.

[View in full page](/clocks/tv-ident-01/) - It just runs in the browser, and if you want to install it as an 'app' you can use Chrome's "cast, save & share" tool.
