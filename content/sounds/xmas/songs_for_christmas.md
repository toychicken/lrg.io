Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the Christmas music you and your hipster mates would play, if it wasn't too much of a drag.

I am not allowed to play this album in the family areas during the festive run-up, but funnily enough, by the time the big day arrives, we're all ready for a bit of a palette cleanser...

There's such a great energy in this album. Trad songs and Steven's own alike are performed with a fresh-sounding verve. The standout track for me is "Get behind me, Santa!" which just oozes good humour.
