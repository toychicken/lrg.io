I made a playlist with a mix of old and new tracks in a sort of slightly melancholy, chill vibe. Though I had high hopes for the new Stereolab album, it all feels a bit samey. Aerial Troubles is the stand-out track.

This acts as a bit of a diary entry too - we went to stay at a nice campsite, near Banham Zoo. (All the G family love a zoo). On the Saturday was a little bring-your-own-dog dog show, and our Jack Russell Terrorist won the scurry race! So proud.

This week, I learned a new song for Choir (yes, I'm in a choir), that I hadn't heard before, and loved it. Then I sought out the original, and loved it again - Hero, by Family of the Year.
