It feels a bit odd to say "I love music", because I find it hard to imagine a human that doesn't love music of some form or another. If you don't love music, this part of the site is probably not for you.

My aim here is to write about music and other sonic experiences. I sometimes curate playlists, write about gigs & festivals, and might even share some stuff I've made. Enjoy at a sensible volume&hellip;
