  "Hey @Spotify @SpotifyCares I'm pretty torn about this. On one hand, I love
  your premium family service. On the other, I despise the hate that Alex Jones
  and infowars peddle.

  I don't want my family to have access to this, so I will cancel if necessary.
  Please don't make me. "

Hey [@Spotify](https://twitter.com/@Spotify) [@Spotify](https://twitter.com/@Spotify)Cares I'm pretty torn about this. On one hand, I love your premium family service. On the other, I despise the hate that Alex Jones and infowars peddle.
I don't want my family to have access to this, so I will cancel if necessary. Please don't make me.
