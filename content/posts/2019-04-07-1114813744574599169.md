  Thanks are a formality, and a cultural norm that not everyone subscribes to.
  Don't be a racist. Hire people that will do a good job, and then thank them. "

If you follow this woman's advice, it makes you a petty, insincere person too.

Thanks are a formality, and a cultural norm that not everyone subscribes to. Don't be a racist. Hire people that will do a good job, and then thank them.
