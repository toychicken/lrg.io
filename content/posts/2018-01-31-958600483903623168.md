  "Hey @Twitter if I want my followers to see something I like, I'll RT. If I ❤
  something, that's for me. It's a signal to one person that I like something,

Hey [@twitter](https://twitter.com/@twitter) if I want my followers to see something I like, I'll RT. If I ❤ something, that's for me. It's a signal to one person that I like something, OR a bookmark. 
Likewise, I don't want to see other's likes in my feed.
