Oh, hello! Nice to see you. Have we met somewhere before? You look awfully familiar... perhaps you know me from:

* ~Twitter~ - I _was_ @toychicken, but since Elon bought it, I decided to gradually leave. (Status, now 100% free of X). I'm now frequently on...
* [@toychicken@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@toychicken) - yes, I know it's not the coolest instance, but I've got a lot on my plate. This is my social platform of choice, closely followed by:
* [@toychicken.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/toychicken.bsky.social) - where I follow friends that don't have a Fediverse presence. I don't post much here, but I suspect I might more in future.
* I _am_ on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leighgarland/), but it's all business there. It's a good way to catch up with me if we've worked together in the past. (Or worked near each other). I will definitely get back to you if you connect, but sometimes it takes a while.
* Technically, I'm on Facebook and Instagram. I mean, I _really_ don't check these, and will probably permanently delete my Meta accounts soon.
* You can always drop me an email, I'm leigh@toychicken.co.uk 

Honestly, I really like to talk on the phone or even a video call, but I guess we need to know each other a bit before I'll give you my phone number. A browser-based video call is always good though!

If we haven't met before, you can learn a little more [about me](/about) here, and if you want to know what I'm up to (especially if we haven't spoken for a while), you should probably check my [now page](/now). I would really like to catch up!
