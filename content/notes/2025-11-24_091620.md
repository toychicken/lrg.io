I am broken on the wheel of trying to manage hospital stuff; trying to do a big bid for some money to be able to continue some R&D work; pitching for more _work_ work; 

So tired. Can't sleep. Brain fried. Physically glitching. 

I'm burning my social media, because frankly, it's like screaming into the void. I don't have any _friends_ there. Occasionally, people laugh at some of the things I say, but I'm increasingly beginning to think it's the kind of laughter you hear when you approach a stranger in the street and ask them where they got that lovely dress.
