Knackered today, because I stayed up watching the final of Physical:Asia last night. It's a totally idiotic self-indulgence, but I really enjoy the combination of the physical challenges with the (mostly) gentle competition of the teams. Except Australia, who were chirpy, but _so_ full of themselves!
