Hmm, turns out I'm having _"ideas"_ again, which often results in site breakages. Not helped by the fact that Hugo has announced potentially breaking [changes in the templating system](https://gohugo.io/templates/new-templatesystem-overview/) - I'm going to try an upgrade and see what happens... wish me luck.
