Jan 3rd or 4th... what day even is it?

Today have taken the opportunity, whilst recovering from a really nasty 'flu bug, to fall down the rabbit hole of not one, but two fantastic public domain image sites. There's the Public Domain Image Archive, which I think is based in the UK.

and then Public Work, which seems to be more USA centric.

I'll definitely be making the most of some of these incredible images!
