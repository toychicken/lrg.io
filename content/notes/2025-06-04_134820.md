Oh my goodness. [That took a lot of work](/notes/2025-06-03_094823), I'd really screwed up in many ways. Broke the [Hugo](/software/hugo-tips/) templates; Had simply _missed_ a whole swathe of image references I'd imported from elsewhere AND went down a very fruitful Obsidian / Dataview rabbit hole 🕳 🐇

* [ ] Must write up a post about Obsidian & Dataview as a CMS for Hugo.

All done now, as far as I can tell.
