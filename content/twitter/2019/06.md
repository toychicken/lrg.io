I'm confused, how is being anti-fascist (anti-trump) a position that would trouble traditional (Northern?) Labour voters or metropolitan middle-class lefties? Don't we all hate fascism? Could it be something that's not about Brexit? üò±

[@petetrainor](https://twitter.com/@petetrainor)  I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you, but isn't one of the perceived benefits of [#Ai](/tags/Ai) precisely that it _doesn't_ emulate human cognition? That, time-and-again human thinking is proven to be prone to poor judgement when using instinctive behaviours over systematic thought?

[@debugwand](https://twitter.com/@debugwand)  [@petetrainor](https://twitter.com/@petetrainor)  I appreciate the bias issues and I don't think they're separate or likely to go away. Perhaps what I'm trying to get at is that emulating human behaviour possibly isn't the best route to, or measure of, intelligence? Might AI simply be different?

[@petetrainor](https://twitter.com/@petetrainor)  [@debugwand](https://twitter.com/@debugwand)  I did, but is 'instinctual' behaviour the right kind to aim for? Instincts are typically formed as survival mechanisms because humans are not able evaluate situations quickly, so use shortcuts (bias) as a way to make decisions quickly. Perhaps this is a semantics query üòÄü§î?

And, should they defect to the lib Dems, will be propping up the Tories in the GE. They'll pat themselves on the back and go back to sleep, whilst austerity and sale of the NHS slip under their unconscious noses.

For some reason I was reminded of Brecht this morning, and felt like we could all do with a bit of Brechtian theatre (or other media) in our lives.

Re-watching Deadwood from the beginning (still one of the greatest showcases of dialogue on TV) and got a big wave of nostalgia for the track at the end of S1E5. I listened to this album so many times, I bought a harmonica.

[@benaustwickart](https://twitter.com/@benaustwickart)  Pretty sure it was this one, and although it says 'electronic' on it, i think it was pretty limited. Also, if I remember, the lenses were Nikon clones, and pretty reasonable.

[@catherinerowett](https://twitter.com/@catherinerowett)  He's far more duplicitous - saying something that he knows will appear to confirm him as a 'no bullshit PC, man of the people' - he seeks to polarise and divide. This is just one salvo.

...we'd been really busy on the phones for over a month, and we built up quite the backlog of postal complaints. Typically, people sent a bit of wood, or a sliver of glass stuck to a postcard. We would open it, try to find the matching case on the computer, and send a voucher...

As a student, I was working for a supermarket at their head office customer services. Mostly spending the hot days that summer on the phone talking to customers about whether they'd really found a dead rat in their toilet paper, or glass on their mayonnaise. Anyhoo...

Me and this girl decided we'd try to rack up a bit of overtime pay, and offered to spend the weekend going through the backlog. It was mid August, and did I mention it had been hot?

Sunday morning came, and the girl sits opposite me, and we grab a big pile of envelopes...

... Out slops what had been, at the start of the summer, a defective wheel of brie. But was now some kind of cheese-based chemical weapon. It splurges over the girls lap, the soggy remains of the complaint letter stuck to her fingers. 

Oh god, the smell. The look on her face...

Ugh, the Blair / Corbyn arguments are so fucking typical of the left. 

Yes, Blair / brown was deeply deeply flawed, but to discount a brief hiatus in the otherwise downward spiral since 1979 as evil, is pointing the guns at the wrong enemy.

Later comrades, later.

[@petetrainor](https://twitter.com/@petetrainor)  [@dancharvey](https://twitter.com/@dancharvey)  Novelty in terms of patent law barely requires any 'new' idea, just a unique assemblage of existing ideas.



Novelty has no intrinsic worth, unless it's actually solving a problem. Patent law has evolved to stop problems remaining solved unless you're the owner of the patent.

[@dancharvey](https://twitter.com/@dancharvey)  [@petetrainor](https://twitter.com/@petetrainor)  Patent law was originally intended as a consumer protection mechanism. "Buy Boyles Widgets! The only widgets that work! (Pat. 1812)" But, those laws became sticks to beat others with. The guarantee of a patent became a method to quash competition rather than serve people. Sigh

[@lizzydoe](https://twitter.com/@lizzydoe)  [@Elif_Safak](https://twitter.com/@Elif_Safak)  This is the root of populism. Appeal to the emotion rather than reason, and you can get people to do anything. Down that road is flag-waving jingoism, all the way to 'killing for something you believe in'. Better to be mindful and reasonable, surely?

[@4m3thy5t](https://twitter.com/@4m3thy5t)  I got nothing. Let's do a little experiment...



Let's say here how much you love vintage microscopes. You repeat back with a like and some affirmation about how much you love vintage microscopes. Then see how long before you get a highly targeted ad...

[@4m3thy5t](https://twitter.com/@4m3thy5t)  It's Mario in a raccoon outfit, but it's the saucy pose!
