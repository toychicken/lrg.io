[@UKLabour](https://twitter.com/@UKLabour)  Labour have forgotten how our democracy works (however badly). We vote for local MP, and government is formed by them, and the party leader is usually made PM. Sunak is not president. His constituents voted for him. Tories made him PM. Same as Labour. Don't like it? Support PR!
