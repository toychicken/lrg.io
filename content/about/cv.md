I have been making things with computers for about 35 years. The last 20 have almost exclusively been on the web, and the last 12 have been delivering web products and applications for some of the worlds biggest banks, retailers, airlines, newspapers, and government departments.

As a developer and product owner, I have an unique ability to manage requirements, teams and stakeholders to deliver world-class products.

In 2015 I founded Studio Zero, to deliver new digital products, and help companies large and small realise new business models via the web and emerging media.

Every Friday is Hawaiian-shirt Friday.

## Experience

### Studio Zero Ltd
Work as Studio Zero includes

*   **John Lewis Ventures**

    Working for one of John Lewis Ventures' earliest (and most successful) propositions - Cook Well. My role is to help it transform from it's early MVP state into a stable, scalable product that would work well with the parent (Waitrose) brand. It's a small cross-functional team, and I work closely with the UX team and product owner to define requirements, respond to user research. I also manage the offshore development team.

*   **XR R&D**

    In January 2017 I undertook a self-funded 9 month research and development project. Exploring future possibilities for Web-based AR and VR. I built a custom Web VR editing tool, and worked with a number of high-profile organisations to research their futures in immersive technology.

*   **Blend Media**

    I built a WebVR editor tool for Blend.Media, using React & Redux on the front end. The initial prototype (built in around 3 weeks) was using AWS S3 as the store, which was then handed over to Blend’s backend team, where they built a Phoenix / Firebase / S3 system to our API spec.

    The front-end continued with React & Redux - using Mozilla’s Aframe.io for the VR elements (and Aframe-react). Aframe was at an early stage of development and I had to make some contributions to Aframe just to get our project working! We used Karma / Mocha for testing. In the initial stages, I managed the product delivery, then helped their product owner plan & execute a user-testing & MVP strategy.

*   **Tesco**

    I was working on a number of projects, in a consultative role, and as a developer. Their prototype team had already established a pattern of working with MeteorJS, but I introduced them to using React on the front-end, as a way to help them recruit and retain new prototype staff (as Meteor was not a common skillset) - plus it fitted with the company’s overall strategy of using React across the business.

    I built out the digital design platform tool, which enabled shared React components to be reused by all the different departments across Tesco, collaborating closely with stakeholders in technical and non-tech domains

*   **RBS / Natwest**

    In 2015, I worked for RBS / Natwest building a new, in-branch account opening system, built using the bank’s custom component system, Zambezi, but then had to do a rebuild, using React / Redux, when the platform failed to meet some core performance requirements for the system.

    We focussed very heavily on an agile TDD / BDD approach for developing the product, working closely with the product ownership team. Given the legacy of RBS (an incredibly slow-moving organisation) in the course of a year, I helped move them onto rapid (2 week) deployment cycles, and a very strong agile process. Prior to this, release cycles were in the order of 6 months.

### Director of Web Technology - Nice Agency
_July 2013 – February 2015_

As Director of Web Technology I was responsible for building out a web team, bringing web application capabilities to complement Nice's existing mobile tech skills. I was responsible for the delivery of all the UK based web projects, as well as being involved in hands-on delivery for a number of significant projects.

In 2014, I lead the team that delivered the award-winning <a href="http://i100.co.uk" target="_blank">i100.co.uk</a> for the Independent. An entirely new viral news property, which has exceeded all expectations at launch, and has garnered fantastic praise from across the industry. We built it entirely from scratch, with Node.js, creating a bespoke, highly-optimised CMS for viral news writers; and a responsive mobile-optimised front-end.

### Freelance Senior front-end developer & agile team lead
_October 2012 – July 2013_

I specialised in agile front-end development for large-scale, high-traffic, e-commerce, single-page apps and marketing sites; particularly media, retail and travel industries. Worked for a major national newspaper group to produce their first tablet-specific hybrid app.

### Senior UX Designer & Developer - Featurespace

I was responsible for the UX design and development at Featurespace. A company that uses real-time and predictive analytics to solve business problems like fraud, customer attrition and much more.

### EU Interactive Development Lead - SapientNitro (Now part of Publicis Groupe)
_June 2007 – February 2012_

As EU lead for interactive development, I managed a team of talented developers and had responsibility for the quality of delivery of every project including estimating, planning, front-end architecture, testing and ultimately, code delivery. I worked very closely with our delivery teams in US, India & Singapore, and the UX and Graphic Design track in the UK.

As a project lead, I helped manage multidisciplinary teams to maintain a high standard of execution and user experience, working closely with business analysts, account team, design and development tracks in this client-facing role. Projects include:

    Responsible for early-stage interactive prototyping and architecture for a significant re-platforming project. Plus consulting on content production and social media services.
