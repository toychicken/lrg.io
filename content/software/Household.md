## Design for the domestic

I've always wanted a _proper_ household management app (or suite), I've tried a few, and I've even thought about building my own. But (because capitalism) I need to spend my computer hours building stuff for other people, so can't afford to do a good job by myself.

Increasingly though, I wonder if there's genuinely a market for a really good 'household' app suite that handles finances, scheduling, homework, housework, days out, insurance renewals, pension advice whatever, but critically jobs that needs to be done within the context of a _household_ which is very different from similar tools you might use to run a business.

Take task management. In a business, tasks have to be done or people lose their jobs. They lose their income. Task management apps take the work-for-money context as given. They don't need to tie it to reward, or duty, or "because I said so". Sure we can use Trello to handle housework duties, but someone has to enforce it AND, because it's not designed for domestic environments, it requires additional coordination (often by a parent, usually mum).

Also task and project management apps are often focussed on relatively short timelines, with a programme of work that has little repetition and lots of dependencies. If you're looking after a house, you may only need to renew the exterior paintwork every 5 years. A job for a long weekend perhaps, but try plotting that in MS project... err, what's the dependency? Why does the same job need to be done _again_?

The kind of timelines for domestic tasks are really complex, and inadequately served by conventional business tools. For instance, domestic tasks often need to be managed by exception. "I need to make a packed lunch for the kids every day" is easy. You don't need to write it down, because, well, you do it every day. You wouldn't track this in Jira. It'd be crazy. However, if you _didn't_ need to make a packed lunch every other Thursday during term time, because they have a school cookery club how would you even track that?

Similarly, when you do "housework" there are things that need doing every day, every week, every month, every season, every year, every N years... and, of course, people have been mentally managing this for hundreds of years. When I say people, I mean women. So when I talk about household management, I need to be cognisant of the fact that there's a LOT of invisible work often done by women and that any tool to 'manage' it must, must, must NOT increase that workload, or diminish it's value, or trivialise the effort required to remember all the shit that needs to be done.

Some tasks are highly contextual with abstract dependencies. "Kid A needs to shower this evening rather than tomorrow morning, because they'll have had football practice, but they're going to school early to set up for the harvest festival. Oh, they also need to take some items for Harvest festival. Oh, and they need to take cash to buy something from the stalls. Oh, and they'll be walking home with Friend B because their parent's are both working late..." It goes on. 

Other tasks have less visible context, like "We need to paint the house" might actually mean "We need to repaint all the exterior woodwork, as it's beginning to look a bit flaky" and that in itself has lots of implied dependencies or decisions, like "Are we going to paint it the same colour?", "Who is going to do the work?", "Do they feel confident they know what to do?", "Can we still buy the paint we used last time?", "Where are the ladders?", "Didn't we lend them to Neighbour X?" etc. etc.

The challenges for a household task management system is... hair-raising. Not least because, in order for it to make money, people have to pay me to build this. Who would do that? Is it actually valuable, or is it fine to continue to assume that Mum will continue to do this job?

This is all done in the face of increasing pressure for households on time, money and activity. Households are not required to be 'productive', but managing them needs to be effective, and make efficient use of resources. Again, drivers for effectiveness are different. My kids aren't being paid  to go to school, and they may never think about Geography once they've left school, but they DO need to do their geography homework. They also need to have a great childhood and be children. If I am doing a Monday-to-Friday, 9-5 job, then perhaps it's easy to make a separation between work & play. Weekdays the kids 'work' do school stuff, do household chores, whatever - then we 'play' at the weekend. Fine<sup>TM</sup>. 

Not so Fine<sup>TM</sup> if I'm doing 2 part-time jobs, with split shifts and weekend hours. Any management tool that helps me be effective needs to accommodate odd working hours, and fragmented time for fun. 

Also, not every household is a typical 2 parents, 2 children setup. You might have multigenerational families. Older children that are away at university during term-time. You might be a 'found family' of adults, or not a 'family' at all - simply a household of people living together because it's cheaper than living separately. It might be a huge household combining all of these elements, but need to coordinate money things, task things, work things, maintenance things etc. etc. No assumptions should be made about how people choose to live together, only the reality that shit needs to get done.

OK, so that's scratching the surface of the 'how things might need to get done' - but now... what about the 'what things might need to get done'?

We've already talked about homework (school) and housework (cleaning, meal-planning, maintenance) but there's also financial stuff (banking, insurance, pensions etc), job stuff (careers, education etc), fun stuff (days out, holidays, clubs, socials, meals out, birthdays, weddings etc. etc.).  There's also outcomes from these things that you might want to record, or share, or hide, or reminisce over - so photos / videos, social media updates, important document storage, gym goals & exercise tracking, medical information, ... whole life stuff.  Oh god, it's all just so much... stuff.

Surely this is too big for an 'app'? Maybe. There are some big challenges, that's for sure.

One hard challenge is probably resolving conflicts of priority of doing one thing over another. How do you quantify the value of 'fun' against 'doing your tax return'? Both are required, but given one time slot today, how does an _app_ choose which to surface? How does it decide whether to do that thing today vs tomorrow? Does it have to?

Another is a bit like a packing problem. My household would not do well with an app that tried to schedule _everything_. There would be mutiny. However, I know that there are people that (appear to) love the juggling of getting from one club to another across town, whilst picking up dry cleaning, or squeezing in quick shop so they can do batch cooking for the next week. Some folks need space and flexibility. Some need a definite plan, and confidence in the timings.

There's also a 'fuck it' factor. My family would probably be fine if we missed a few household chores one week in order to do an ad-hoc trip to the cinema or simply staring at the TV for an extra hour.  So we definitely wouldn't want a good household app to become a nag, or accumulate tasks-to-be-done. Other households would _rarely_ allow even the smallest jobs to be dismissed.

I think there are some things we can do as task-setters / communicators that might help. Mostly around context and consequences. Why does this task need  to be done. What will happen if this task _isn't_ completed? How do I _do_ this task? What things need to be in place in order to get this task done. 

This is not news to anyone doing project management, but is not always commonly done in the context of household work. Important financial decisions can feel overwhelming and highly risky, even if they're not. Minuscule chore items can feel like they should be 'just known' even if you've never ever done them before...

Small divergence into an illustrative story... 

> In this, there's a man and a woman, with 2 kids. Both parents work. Suddenly the woman is taken ill, and is not going to be able to do her share of the household chores for a while. Let's face it - it's most of the cooking, cleaning, childcare and domestic management. 
> 
> The man says "don't worry honey, I'll manage it all, you should rest". 
> 
> The man wants to step up, but is instantly overwhelmed by the volume of these tasks that, to him, have been essentially "done by magic" as far as he's concerned. He doesn't know where things are, does't really know how to do the jobs properly. He goes over the top on "cleaning the bathroom" and details it like he's valeting a car. Is proud of how good it looks, but now thinks... "shit, I have to do this every day, for every room in the house", it's impossible.
> 
> So he goes to his wife, and says "Can I have a list of the jobs?", thinking that she must have managed this very carefully, and/or had some magic way of doing things that meant she could achieve all the work. She looks up from her sick bed and says "fuck off". 

 He has failed to realise that a significant chunk of the work of work, is thinking about the work. He has also failed to realise that this work is to a certain extent continuously and opportunistically managed. A list is just a list. "Cleaning the bathroom", "Vacuuming the stairs", "Feeding the kids" is really just a convenient (to him) summarisation of what is actually a far larger set of micro-tasks that are not articulated.

You don't "clean the bathroom". The bathroom remains in a state of relative cleanliness by acts of wiping, spraying, drying, polishing, vacuuming, dusting, shopping and waste disposal. These acts may not be contiguous. Perhaps it's a good time to do _all_ the vacuuming in the house. Perhaps it's just possibly to handle vacuuming the bathroom, because you've got 5 minutes spare after vacuuming the adjacent room.

There is no fucking way an _app_ could manage this kind of micro-task management, but it could perhaps help quantify some of those micro-tasks, surface the kinds of tools or methods required, essentially provide some visibility of the context and consequences. Maybe even codify some household rules that keep the "bathroom in a state of cleanliness"...

Now, in contrast to this. Imagine "buying life insurance for the first time". How does the realisation that you _need_ life insurance happen? What tips you into buying it? How do you judge what you should buy? Who to buy it from? These feel like very high stakes, because if you fuck it up,  you will be out of pocket at the worst possible time. Unless you're a financial advisor however, or have a network of people that habitually talk about this stuff, you may well know nothing, so little in fact that you'd be hard-pressed to know where to start. Of course, you can research it yourself, or seek professional advice (you should always do that). But, how do you know _when_ life cover is something you need?

Not the end of the story, but perhaps this chapter

Update: 6/11/2025

I had a thought today about this in general, and specifically about the way that the kids homework gets assigned. I have a permanent bee in my bonnet about the desperately poor way that schools communicate - and particularly about homework. I now have to have 6 different apps installed on my phone just to see what is coming up. Teams tells me about assignments (because apparently we're American now), but doesn't make a distinction between in-class or home-based work. The other apps are class specific. One each for maths, english, spanish, tech and geography. Each with an 'inbox', each with a parade of sales-pitchy notifications that are not about work to be done.

(Don't get me started about how school holidays are not even calendar events - and are focussed on when term time is, rather than when holidays are)

How would I solve this? Off the top of my head - a dedicated 'school' app / service. It'd handle the external stuff of schools interactions with parents. e.g. Payments, school dinner selections, homework management, school trip coordination etc etc. App providers would have to syndicatte / federate with the app. The aim being LESS THINKING REQUIRED for parents.

This isn't a productivity app (though I guess you could allow folks to build motivational mechanisms on top? Plugins?) - just a one-stop shop for info. Calendar items can appear in - shock horror - your calendar. Payment requests can be paid via a trusted mechanism, not some shonky-looking, b-team Worldpay subdomain. Thoughtful notifications about important things, sent via appropriate mechanisms. 

The ability to give certain tasks to one carer. Does Dad make lunches - then he needs to know about things that affect that. Does Grandma pick up on Thursdays - she needs to know about timetabling updates. Does Mum occasionally need to just-drop-everything-and-handover-to-Dad because she has an important meeting? There should be a button for that.

I guess this is an extension of my thoughts about the household app - much of the work of a household with children is managing school stuff. It's hard enough with one child, with conventional office hours. What must it be like if you're a single parent, on split shifts, with 3 kids at 3 different schools? 

There's also things like EHCPs, handling behavioural difficulties, separated parents, SEND support, emergency contact details, GDPR... stuff that is serious  for schools as well as parents. The traditional 'document' format isn't up to this. Also  - what about parents with very limited access to the internet / apps. I know it sounds implausible, but many households with young children _only_ have Mum's phone to get access; or the browser on the TV; or an old iPad from 2013. I guess some households may not have ANY access at all, or sporadic access. How is that handled?

Update 24/11/2025

Oh wow. Another thing that needs to go into the mix here. Health. Managing health is, by itself, not necessarily complex... but it's never by itself. It's mixed in with your life. Taking time to go to hospital, follow up on scans & tests (and try to understand the results), attend regular appointments, manage side effects of drugs, manage the drugs, handle prescriptions etc etc. It's mind boggling.

(I can't imagine how stressful this must be if you're also trying to find ways to _pay_ for it as well - looking at you USA 😠)
