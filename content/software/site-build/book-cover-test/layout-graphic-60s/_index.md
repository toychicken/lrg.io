This style is strongly inspired by paperbacks of the 1960s and 70s, with a strong graphic image and a modern sans-serif typeface.

If the author attribute is not defined, the layout will put "Anonymous" in it's place. This style works well with contrasty images, and is not too fussy about aspect ratio. Portrait orientation around 15:19 will work best.

All the definitions:
