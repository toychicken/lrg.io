A while back, I gave myself the task of [redesigning my website (again)](/software/site-build/). Originally my vision was to re-create a whole load of [vintage book covers](/software/site-build/design_process/) specifically inspired by vintage penguin paperbacks. 

Now I'm at the stage of feeling pretty pleased with what I've done so far, but before I go any further I need to start testing what I've built already. As ever, it's only when you start to test that you begin to realise how many variations you've built into what feels like a relatively simple design system.

What follows is a short set of notes about what I've made, how I did it, how to invoke the styles, and what some of the limitations are.
