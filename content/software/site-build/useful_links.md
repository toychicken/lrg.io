### Matrix transforms

Found this useful [matrix transform tool](https://angrytools.com/css-generator/transform/), handly for getting the transforms right on my 'covers' on the index page. Each book is ever-so-slightly on the wonk.

### Grainy gradients

I was trying to add a little grain to my gradients on the book covers. The awesome folks at CSS-TRICKS had my back, even if I decided not to use it in the end. 

https://css-tricks.com/grainy-gradients/ 

It came with it's [own tool](https://grainy-gradients.vercel.app/) for generating them. ![Screengrab of the grainy gradient tool](/images/grainy-gradient-playground.png)

### CSS Grid Generator

I really wish I'd found this earlier, https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/

### Easing functions

When I started building out my [colour clocks](/colourful-clocks/) this was [a REALLY helpful site](https://easings.net/) for doing some of the springier elements of the animation.

### Making better link-preview cards

This worked like magic for me! https://kittygiraudel.com/2022/04/02/accessible-cards/
