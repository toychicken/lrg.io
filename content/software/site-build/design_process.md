## Best wwwebsite ever!
 
 ![](penguin_covers.png)
It' going to look like the coolest fucking shelf of penguin books you've ever seen. 

From the home page, every folder or article, or experiment page will present as cool 70s penguin book cover. Once inside... something a bit more like a typed page... but, I'm  not too worried about that.

## Structure

### Cover grid

There's an underlying grid


A bit like:

![](penguin_grid_example.png)
Not the left third of the top grid is typically empty - exact proportions - see grid

![](redesign_cover_grid.png)
For later full-bleed image styles like![](penguin_70s_sci-fi_covers.png)

Where the circle represents the focus area of the main image. Obviously subject to some artistic license.

I _could_ just make each of these images by themselves as a standalone png... but where's the fun in that? I want to make it flexible, and use SVGs and filters and perhaps animation.

I want to have that hauntology feel

### Colours

Here's a useful link about the colours of early penguin books - https://countryhouselibrary.co.uk/blogs/our-seasonal-book-selections/what-do-the-colours-of-penguin-books-mean



## Content

Everything man - put myself out there. A polymath. Or at least a semimath

Music
Playlists
Articles
Stupid micro posts
Good micro posts
Short fiction
Reviews
Extended thoughts
Edited thoughts
Sounds I like
Experiment page

They can all have fun names like

**An LRG extended memes collection**
or
**LRG musical fart noise series**
or
**LRG shit I've made up volume 3** 

## Other style
