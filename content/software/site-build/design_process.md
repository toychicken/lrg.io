## Best wwwebsite ever! ‚úä
 
 ![A bookshelf of vintage penguin paperbacks](penguin_covers.png)
It's going to look like the coolest fucking shelf of penguin books you've ever seen.  At least, it will eventually...

From the home page, every folder or article, or experiment page will present as cool 70s penguin book cover. Once inside... something a bit more like a typed page... but, I'm  not too worried about that.

## Structure

### Cover grid

There's an underlying grid to the typical penguin layout


A bit like:

![Some sample penguin book covers](penguin_grid_example.png)
Not the left third of the top grid is typically empty - exact proportions - see grid

![An illustration reference for the cover grid](redesign_cover_grid.png)
For later full-bleed image styles like![1970s penguin sci-fi covers](penguin_70s_sci-fi_covers.png)

Where the circle represents the focus area of the main image. Obviously subject to some artistic license.

I _could_ just make each of these images by themselves as a standalone png... but where's the fun in that? I want to make it flexible, and use SVGs and filters and perhaps animation.

I want to have that hauntology feel, but created using modern CSS.

### Colours

The original series of Penguin paperbacks had a colour cods. Here's a useful link about the colours of early penguin books - https://countryhouselibrary.co.uk/blogs/our-seasonal-book-selections/what-do-the-colours-of-penguin-books-mean

I'm not going to stick to that slavishly, but let it inform some of my category colours perhaps üòÅ
## Content

Everything man - put myself out there. A polymath. Or at least a semimath

- Music
- Playlists
- Articles
- Stupid micro posts
- Good micro posts
- Short fiction
- Reviews
- Extended thoughts
- Edited thoughts
- Sounds I like
- Experiment page

They can all have fun names like

**An LRG extended memes collection**

or

**LRG musical fart noise series**

or

**LRG shit I've made up volume 3**
