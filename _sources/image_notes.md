Thought it might be useful to capture some info on the images

Book cover images should be optimised for the shape they're in... so the question is... what is that size.

Max resolution for the OG image is 1200x627, with a 790x627 'safe zone' in the middle. So the main image _should_ live inside that space (almost 2/3 of the width)
