# TODO


* ~~Add 'follow buttons' for playlists - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets/guides/adding-a-spotify-follow-button/~~
* Make playlist sections get data from https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/working-with-playlists/ - including images???
* Add a 'contact me' page - which just lists all the ways to contact me, with a good Twitter / Facebook card data.
* ~~Dark section for 'miscallaenous' - descriptions of experiments, culture reviews, architecture, music, games etc.~~
* A 'Grey' section for code stuff, and useful snippets?
* ~~Add pictures to homepage article listing~~
* Add 'tweet-length' elements into the homepage - mainly so very short thoughts / links out can be surfaced
* Organise the 'useful stuff' article into a whole subsection - possibly surfacing links :point_up: that way.
